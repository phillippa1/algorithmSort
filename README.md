# Visual Algorithm Sorter

A web-based visualization tool for sorting algorithms that demonstrates how different sorting techniques work through animated bar charts.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: Numbers are displayed as colored bars for easy visualization
- **Interactive Sorting**: Watch algorithms sort in real-time
- **Color-Coded Progress**: 
  - Red bars: Unsorted elements
  - Green bars: Sorted elements
- **Array Generation**: Click "Generate New Array" to create a fresh set of random numbers
- **Currently Implemented**: Merge Sort algorithm

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Generate New Array" to create a new set of random numbers
3. Select Merge Sort to watch the algorithm visualize the sorting process
4. Observe how the red bars transform to green as they get sorted into the correct positions

## Future Enhancements

- Additional sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, etc.)
- Speed controls for animation
- Array size customization
- Algorithm comparison features

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
